  So. You want to learn how to properly implement SEO for your website. 
  The question is: how are you going to make things right?

  Take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years;

  We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
  Next time those black hat SEO turkeys try to convince you to something that you know is wrong, 
  just think to yourself, 

  'What would Captain America do?'

  Without further ado...
