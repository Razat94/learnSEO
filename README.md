  So. You want to learn how to properly implement SEO for your website. 
  The question is: how are you going to make things right? 
  Maybe you want your website to look cool and gain traffic. 
  Take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years; 
  the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules. 
  We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
  Next time those black hat SEO turkeys try to convince you to something that you know is wrong, 
  just think to yourself, 

  'What would Captain America do?'

## <p align="center"> HERE'S HOW TO DEVELOP AN SEO FRIENDLY WEBSITE </p>

I really enjoyed Moz's guide to SEO. I will try to write this guide in a similar fashion by following
[Mozs Pyramid of Greatness](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo)
  <div align = "center">

### <p id = "toc"> Table of Contents </p>
1. [Crawl accessibility](#crawl) so engines can reach and index your content
2. [Compelling content](#compellingContent) that answers the searcher’s query
3. [Keyword optimized](#keywordOptimized) to attract searchers & engines
4. [Great user experience](#GreatUX) including a fast load speed, ease of use, and compelling UI on any device
5. [Share-worthy content](#shareWorthy) that earns links, citations, and amplification
6. [Title, URL, & description](#onsiteOptimazation) to draw high CTR in the rankings
7. [Snippet/schema markup](#snippet/schema) to stand out in SERPs

####Make sure your website is crawlable.

- [ ] Check for broken links, and fix any that you find.
Here are some ways I do it:
- https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/
- https://error404.atomseo.com/
- https://www.drlinkcheck.com/
- [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/broken-link-checker/) can also find broken links 

Additionally, make sure you have no broken images. Make sure images include alt attribute. 
Please note: Alt attributes are not allowed on the <a> tag. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14850187/is-it-correct-to-use-alt-tag-for-an-anchor-link)
For the robots.txt file, make sure it correctly suggests which parts of your site search engines should and shouldn't crawl
Utilize a XML/HTML sitemap.
You can submit the sitemap.xml file to both Google Search Console & Bing Webmaster Tools
Make sure the noindex meta tag is NOT added.
Make sure you can access every page through links. If you want a search engine to find a page, make sure it can be linked from other pages. If it can't find it, it's good as invisible.

Don't include hidden text and links [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66353?hl=en)
Don't cloak your pages [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355?hl=en&ref_topic=6001971)

Crawl depth for your website should be no more than 3. (Also good for UX & for potential crawlers). 
Avoid nesting pages under irrelevant folders, and try to keep your URL length short. 
example.com/2015/april/what-is-seo/ -> example.com/what-is-seo/
Keywords in URL

Have ssl enabled. It implies a symbol of trust to your users & search engines alike. [Source](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)
