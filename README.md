  So. You want to learn how to properly implement SEO for your website. 
  The question is: how are you going to make things right? 
  Maybe you want your website to look cool and gain traffic. 
  Take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years; 
  the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules. 
  We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
  Next time any of those black hat SEO turkeys try to convince you to something that you know is wrong, 
  just think to yourself, 

  'What would Captain America do?'
```

<p align="center"> 
  All jokes aside, the main point of SEO is to improve your websites visibility, traffic, and search rankings.
  This guide is meant for people who get stuck on trying to optimize a site, and would like to follow good generalized SEO practices to change their websites accordingly.
  Please note however that even if you somehow complete all of the checklists on this page, it doesn't gurantee users that they will rank first.
  All it means is that your page has the potential of being listed on a SERP.
  Without further ado...

## <p align="center"> HERE'S HOW TO DEVELOP AN SEO FRIENDLY WEBSITE </p>

I really enjoyed Moz's guide to SEO & Google's SEO Starter guide. 
This "guide" could not have been written without it. I can't recommend strongly enough to read them.
[Mozs Pyramid of Greatness](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) & [Googles SEO Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).
Just like I stated in  the disclaimer, please note that this guide will not make your website rank #1 on your searches. My guide is written by reading Googles guide, and even they say this:
> This guide won't provide any secrets that'll automatically rank your site first in Google (sorry!), 
> but following the best practices outlined below will hopefully make it easier for search engines to crawl, index and understand your content.

### <p id = "toc"> Table of Contents </p>
1. [Crawl accessibility](#crawl) so engines can reach and index your content
2. [Compelling content](#compellingContent) that answers the searcher’s query
3. [Keyword optimized](#keywordOptimized) to attract searchers & engines
4. [Great user experience](#GreatUX) including a fast load speed, ease of use, and compelling UI on any device
5. [Share-worthy content](#shareWorthy) that earns links, citations, and amplification
6. [Title, URL, & description](#onsiteOptimazation) to draw high CTR in the rankings
7. [Snippet/schema markup](#snippet/schema) to stand out in SERPs

<h4>**In short, make sure your website is crawlable.**</h4>

- [ ] Make sure you can access every page of your website through internal links.
> Note: If you want a search engine to find a page, make sure it can be linked from other pages. If it can't find it, it's good as invisible.
  <div align = "center">
    <img src = "images/links.PNG">
  </div>

- [ ] Utilize a XML/HTML sitemap. [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en)
> Note: You can submit the sitemap.xml file to both Google Search Console & Bing Webmaster Tools

- [x] Although it's completely optional, try considering adding breadcrumbs lists to your pages.
Look at <a href = "https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumb">what a breadcrumb is</a> and [how it's useful](https://seo.co/breadcrumbs-help-seo/)

- [ ] Check for broken links, and fix any that you find.
Here are some ways I do it:
- https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/
- https://error404.atomseo.com/
- https://www.drlinkcheck.com/
- [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/broken-link-checker/) can also find broken links 
- [ ] Make sure you also have no broken images. Make sure images include alt attribute. 
> Note: Alt attributes are not allowed on the anchor tag. It's used for images.
> [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14850187/is-it-correct-to-use-alt-tag-for-an-anchor-link)

- [ ] For the robots.txt file, make sure it correctly suggests which parts of your site search engines should and shouldn't crawl.[Source](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt)
- [ ] Make sure the noindex meta tag is NOT added if you want it indexed. [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710?hl=en) 
- [ ] Don't include hidden text and links. [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66353?hl=en)
- [ ] Don't cloak your pages. [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355?hl=en&ref_topic=6001971)
- [ ] Google doesn't see a big advantage at what the URL structure itself looks like, i.e. if there's multiple slashes & nested paths in URLs.
	It however DOES care about crawl depth or how many links someone has to click through to actually get to that content
	[This source](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-click-depth-matters-seo-url-structure/256779/)
	explains [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyQbNGUycX8) video at the 31:09 mark.
> Having said all that, it is still good UX if we keep URL paths short & relevant. [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en#hierarchy)
- [ ] Have ssl enabled. It implies a symbol of trust to your users & search engines alike. [Source](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)
- [ ] Make sure that the DNS is properly set up and both www and non www versions of the site [Source](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/44231?hl=en)
